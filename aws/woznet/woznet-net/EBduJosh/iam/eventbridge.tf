#Roles must be assumed by a user or a service.
#Policies outline what can be done (permissions), and these can be attached to roles OR users. 


#IAM Roles are defined as a set of permissions that grant access to actions and resources in AWS. 
#An IAM Role can be used by or assumed by IAM User accounts or by services within AWS, and can give access to Users from another account altogether. 
#IAM Roles are similar to wearing different hats in that they temporarily let an IAM User or a service get permissions to do things they would not normally get to do.  
#These permissions are attached to the Role itself, and are conveyed to anyone or anything that assumes the role. 
#Also, Roles have credentials that can be used to authenticate the Role identity.
#
#You can assign either a pre-built policy or create a custom policy. A policy is something that will be assigned to a role. 
#Admins of the customer environment create an IAM Policy with a constrained set of access, and then assigns that policy to a new Role, specifically assigned to the providerâ€™s Account ID and External ID.  
#When done, the resulting IAM Role is given a specific Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which is a unique string that identifies the role.
