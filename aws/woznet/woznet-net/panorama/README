# to-do: 

ssh to the ec2 that I just create in woznet

install pem key; chmod 600 .ssh/Toulon.pem 
sudo yum install ansible
pip3 install pan-os-python pan-python pandevice xmltodict
ansible-galaxy collection install paloaltonetworks.panos # not sudo.

main and other playbooks
tar cvf palo_alto_playbooks.tar --exclude "./palo_alto_playbooks/.git" palo_alto_playbooks/

ssh to the panorama instance that we just created in woznet too
ssh -i .ssh/Toulon.pem admin@192.168.4.156 <- the ip of the panorama instance 

set admin password: configure; set mgt-config users admin password; commit



Further setup:

we added something that turned on the Templates and Device Groups Polices and Objects.
Create a device group?
panorama -> device-groups -> add "Test" (only name, I didn't do anything else)
-> Device groups policies and objects have no appeared. With my objects. Woof.
But not templates network and devices. 

I can't see that we can create a device-group by ansible
Or the templates
Also the bad ip addresses. I vaguely remember enabling that in the downloads, or something.
