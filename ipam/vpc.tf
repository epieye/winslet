# iirc vpcs and subnets created known to ipam
# Can I import them?


# create vpcs and subnets known to ipam
# allocate addresses

# then what?


# i like the idea of programmatically
# allocating the subnet, like i did for dx

# presumably cidr block in vpc
# is data.ipam.prod_wi.cidr or something
# and                 .public_subnet[0] or something 

# /22 or whatever is allocated to the account
# vpc
# subnets

# data.ipam.prod_wi.vpc_cidr.next("/18")
